Alog README File
================

Prerequisites
-------------
Alog is written in Ada so you need to have GNAT (GNU Ada Translator)
installed to compile Alog. The library comes in two flavours: base
and full. The base build includes facilities to log to files and
syslog while the full version provides more advanced log facilities
like SMTP, Jabber/XMPP or Postgres. For the full version you need to
have AWS (Ada Web Server) and APQ (Ada95 database binding) installed
(see 'Installation'). GNAT is available for most distributions, make
sure you have gcc version 4.1 or later installed.

Installation
------------
Depending on the build type (base or full) and if you want to run the
tests you need the following libraries/frameworks installed to compile
Alog:

* AWS (Ada Web Server)  :
  https://libre.adacore.com/aws/main.html[]

* Ahven (Test-Framework):
  http://home.gna.org/ahven/[]

* APQ (Ada95 database binding)
  http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3wwg/software.html

The installation of Alog is quite easy and straight forward. Just type
in the following commands. You must be root to install the library
system wide.

[subs="normal"]
  $ tar -xzf libalog-{revision}.tar.bz2
  $ cd libalog-{revision}
  $ make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install

To do a full build you need to set and export the environment variable
ALOG_BUILD to "full" like this:

[subs="normal"]
  $ tar -xzf libalog-{revision}.tar.bz2
  $ cd libalog-{revision}
  $ export ALOG_BUILD="full" make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install

If no `PREFIX` is specified, `$(HOME)/libraries` is used.

Tests
-----
After compiling and linking Alog, you can test if everything works as
expected by typing the following command:

[subs="normal"]
  $ make tests

You should then see a `PASSED` behind each of the tests.
