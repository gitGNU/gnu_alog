Alog README File
================

Alog is a stackable logging framework for Ada. It aims to be straight forward to
use and easily extendable. It provides support for various log facilities,
loglevels and log-message transformations.

Prerequisites
-------------
Alog is written in Ada so you need to have GNAT (the GNU Ada Translator)
installed to compile Alog. The library comes in two flavours: base and full.
The base build includes facilities to log to files and syslog while the full
version provides more advanced log facilities like SMTP, Jabber/XMPP or
PostgreSQL. For the full version you need to have AWS (Ada Web Server) and APQ
(Ada95 database binding) installed (see the 'Installation' section).

GNAT is available for most distributions. Since Alog uses pedantic compiler
flags to check the code, make sure you have gcc version 4.3 or later installed
on your system.

Installation
------------
The base build of Alog has no special library dependencies. To run the testcases
(for both builds), you need to have the Ahven Unit Test-Framework installed:

* Ahven (Test-Framework):
  http://home.gna.org/ahven/[]

To compile the full build, you further need to have the following libraries
installed on your system:

* AWS (Ada Web Server)  :
  https://libre.adacore.com/aws/main.html[]

* APQ (Ada95 database binding)
  http://home.cogeco.ca/~ve3wwg/software.html

The building and installation process of Alog is quite easy and straight
forward. Just type in the following commands. You must be root to install the
library system wide.

.................
  $ tar -xzf libalog-{revision}.tar.bz2
  $ cd libalog-{revision}
  $ make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install
.................

This will compile and install the base build (the default). To do a full build,
you need to set and export the environment variable `BUILD_TYPE` to "full" like
so:

.................
  $ tar -xzf libalog-{revision}.tar.bz2
  $ cd libalog-{revision}
  $ export BUILD_TYPE=full
  $ make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install
.................

If no `PREFIX` is specified, `$(HOME)/libraries` is used.

Tests
-----
After compiling and linking Alog, you can test if everything works as
expected by typing the following command:

.................
  $ make tests
.................

You should then see a `PASSED` behind each of the tests.

Limitations
-----------
The XMPP-Facility is considered experimental. To use this facility the AWS
version from the Adacore subversion repository must be installed. Older
AWS-Versions are not fully XMPP/1.0 compliant.
