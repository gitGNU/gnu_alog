Alog README File
================

Prerequisites
-------------
Alog is written in Ada so you need to have GNAT (GNU Ada Translator)
installed to compile Alog. You further need to have Ahven and AWS
(Ada Web Server) installed (see 'Installation').
GNAT is available for most distributions, make sure you have gcc
version 4.1 or later installed.

Installation
------------
For Alog to compile, you need the following two libraries/frameworks
installed:

* AWS (Ada Web Server)  :
  https://libre.adacore.com/aws/main.html[]

* Ahven (Test-Framework):
  http://home.gna.org/ahven/[]

The installation of Alog is quite easy and straight forward. Just type
in the following commands. You must be root to install the library
system wide.

[subs="normal"]
  $ tar -xzf libalog-{revision}.tar.bz2
  $ cd libalog-{revision}
  $ make
  $ make PREFIX=/usr/local install
